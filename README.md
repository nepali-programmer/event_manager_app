## Event App

Event App uses Api built using Laravel. You must run that project first.

### Running project

1.  Clone the project
2.  This step can be skipped if you are running both the apps on the same device and running this application using an Emulator. Change the ip address to the address where Laravel Project is hosted. You must change \_baseAddress from `event_manager_app/lib/core/api/api_url.dart` file.
3.  Run `pub get`
4.  Run the app
